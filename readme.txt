This program is an aid for students learning different sortin methods. Because I had to 
manually slow them down in order to be able to show the different processes visually, 
the sorts do not represent the correct relative timing of each sort. However, the 
program is mainly meant to simply understand how the data is being moved during the
course of each of the searches. The implemented searches are listed below. 

To Run the program run the commands: 
     javac SorterUI.java
     java SorterUI
     

0.  Bogo Sort
1.  Bottom-Up Merge Sort
2.  Bubble Sort
3.  Cocktail Sort
4.  Comb Sort
5.  Gnome Sort
6.  Insertion Sort
7.  Merge Sort
8.  Odd-Even Sort
